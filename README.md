# SDXL Van Gogh By Stylize

This repository contains the training code and image set for [stylize-van-gogh](https://replicate.com/schmitzandrew/stylize-van-gogh#readme), an SDXL fine-tune trained on scenic Van Gogh paintings. 

You can run the model on Replicate here: https://replicate.com/schmitzandrew/stylize-van-gogh. 

Here are a couple of example images from the model:
